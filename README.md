# react-webpack-redux-starter

Personal starter kit for React, Webpack2 and Redux starter kit.
Nothing is guaranteed to work, nothing is guaranteed to be maintained.

## What do I Start With?
By default, this package comes with the following packages:

1. **react / react-dom**; used for the rendering of the application / definition of components

2. **redux / react-redux**; used for storing / managing state and connecting it to your react components

3. **immutable / immutable-prop-types / react-immutable-render-mixin**; used for managing your  data without having to worry about mutations. the additional libraries deal with the changes that immutable brings into the application

4.  **normalizr / reslect**; used to simplify interactions with "nested" data and redux. see their docs for more information.

5.  **redux-actions**; used to remove boiler plate code when defining actions and handling those actions; also helps standardize your action definitions.

6. **force-vrolayer**; data layer for switching between remote objects and API when developing Visualforce applications

## What does the Webpack Config produce?

With no changes to the application; you can expect the following files when running a build:

1. **main.*hash*.js / main.*hash*.js.map**; the "meat of the application"; everything that the entry point and it's dependencies include. Bundle is of size: 10.8Kb

2. **vendor.*hash*.js / vendor.*hash*.js.map**; all the files that are included through node_modules. These are seperated as they make up the bulk of the application and should not change often. Bundle is of size: 595Kb

4. **x.*hash*.js / x.*hash*.js.map**; a "split" bundle off of main. bundle sizes vary.

## Scripts
This package comes with the following scripts to begin:

1. **npm run start**: Run the webpack-dev-server with hot-reloading. Uses src/index.jsx as the entry point. Webserver launches at https://localhost:8080.

2. **npm run build**: Builds the application using minifcation, tree shaking and bundle splitting. This would be used to produce your "production build". Assets are output to the /build folder

3. **npm run storybook**: Runs the @kadira/storybook package. This lets you see your "stories" and interact with them. Useful for rapid prototyping of components. Webserver launches at http://localhost:9001.

4. **npm run stats**: Runs the webpack-bundle-analyzer which starts a local webserver that details the contents of your package bundle. Useful in finding "problem" dependencies. Webserver launches at http://localhost:8888.

5. **npm run serve:prod**: Runs the build command and than a simple http-server serving the build folder. Used to verify that nothing "wonky" happend during a build and that all assets are properly being copied / packaged. Should be run before issuing a PR. Webserver launches at http://localhost:8080.

6. **npm run test**: Runs the karma test suite. This will create the /coverage folder with lcov coverage reports. Coverage, by default, is only run against src/.

7. **npm run test:watch**: Same as 6; except test will continue to run.
